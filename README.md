# **Break Bread**

## **User stories**
I live several hundred miles from my parents and many of my friends live in far away cities that I don't visit very often.  I don't see them in person, so it's tough to know what they would want or need for holiday gifts that they don't already have.  By finding a new and exciting restaurant near them and getting a gift certificate to it, I can make sure they have a unique experience they otherwise wouldn't and not worry about gift redundancy.  I can further tailor the restaurant returns to foods that I know they like.

## **MVP**
- User authentication through Rails
- Accepts and stores addresses, birthdates, and holidays of note for users' friends and family and budget (person-dependent so you can spend more on your mom)
- Converts addresses to lat/long with Google Geocoding API
- Searches FourSquare for the hottest and best restaurants in their area that fit your budget

## **Reach Goals**
- Google authenticator option
- Calendar engagement that sends you a reminder to purchase gift certificates
- Contact scraping to automatically populate your giftees
- Cuisine preferences saved for each person on your list to better target restaurant choices
